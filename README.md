Is Money the Elixir of Mankind? Exploring the Link Between Life Expectancy, Wealth, and Income Inequality (Canada, 2000–2016)

Analyzed relationships between life expectancy and four economic indicators: healthcare expenditure, income composition of resources (ICOR), GDP, and income inequality (Gini index) using Canadian data (2000–2016).

Built and validated simple linear regression models in R; checked assumptions (linearity, residual independence, homoscedasticity, normality) and assessed fit with R², adjusted R², F-statistics, and RMSE.

Key findings:

Healthcare expenditure showed the strongest positive association with life expectancy (R² ≈ 0.98, RMSE ≈ 0.14).

ICOR also significant after removing outliers (R² ≈ 0.99).

GDP correlated positively but less robust (R² ≈ 0.87).

Gini index analysis (ANOVA + Tukey HSD) revealed significant differences: medium inequality linked to higher life expectancy than low inequality.

Concluded that healthcare investment is the most influential driver of longevity, with income patterns and economic growth also contributing; highlighted complex, sometimes counterintuitive effects of inequality.

Role: Conducted end-to-end data cleaning, regression modeling, diagnostic testing, and policy-oriented interpretation in R.

Tech: R, linear regression, ANOVA, Tukey’s HSD, data visualization
